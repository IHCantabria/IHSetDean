## Summary

Dean (1991) have proposed the concept of an equilibrium beach profile. Dean (1991) derived the equilibrium beach profile model with the wave energy dissipation similar to other previous works (e.g., Bruun, 1954). The equilibrium beach profile equation is very simple, but has been used by many researchers for coastal engineering.

## Model formula

Miller and Dean (2004) suggested a simple shoreline evolution model based on the imbalance of shoreline change between an equilibrium shoreline change and shoreline position as follows:

```text
(∂S(t))/∂t=k(S_eq (t)-S(t))

S(t) : the shoreline position at time t
S_eq : the equilibrium shoreline position
k : the calibration parameter for the rate at which the shoreline approaches equilibrium (k; k=k_a H_b^2; k=k_a H_b^3; k=k_a Ω)
```

Miller and Dean (2004) proposed an equilibrium shoreline change owing to the change of sea level (Fig. 4 1):

```text
S_eq=-W^* (t)((0.068H_b+S)/(B+1.28H_b ))

H_b : the breaking wave height
S : the change in local water level
B : the berm wave height
W^* : the width of the active surf zone
```
